  "description": "ICEberg (Integrative and conjugative elements) is a database of integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) found in bacteria. ICEs are conjugative self-transmissible elements that can integrate into and excise from a host chromosome, and can carry likely virulence determinants, antibiotic-resistant factors and/or genes coding for other beneficial traits. It contains details of ICEs found in representatives bacterial species, and which are organised as families. This collection references ICE elements.",
