  "description": "The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) captures and presents information relating to experimental workflows that are based around nucleotide sequencing. ENA is made up of a number of distinct databases that includes EMBL-Bank, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and the Trace Archive each with their own data formats and standards. This collection references Embl-Bank identifiers.",
