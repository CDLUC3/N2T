  "description": "FaceBase is a collaborative NIDCR-funded consortium to generate data in support of advancing research into craniofacial development and malformation. It serves as a community resource by generating large datasets of a variety of types and making them available to the wider research community via this website. Practices emphasize a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to understanding the developmental processes that create the face. The data offered spotlights high-throughput genetic, molecular, biological, imaging and computational techniques. One of the missions of this consortium is to facilitate cooperation and collaboration between projects.",
