  "description": "Pocketome is an encyclopedia of conformational ensembles of all druggable binding sites that can be identified experimentally from co-crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank. Each Pocketome entry corresponds to a small molecule binding site in a protein which has been co-crystallized in complex with at least one drug-like small molecule, and is represented in at least two PDB entries.",
