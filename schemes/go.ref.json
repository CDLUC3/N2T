  "description": "The GO reference collection is a set of abstracts that can be cited in the GO ontologies (e.g. as dbxrefs for term definitions) and annotation files (in the Reference column). It provides two types of reference; It can be used to provide details of why specific Evidence codes (see http://identifiers.org/eco/) are assigned, or to present abstract-style descriptions of \"GO content\" meetings at which substantial changes in the ontologies are discussed and made.",
