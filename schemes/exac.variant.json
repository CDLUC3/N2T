  "description": "The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) is a coalition of investigators seeking to aggregate and harmonize exome sequencing data from a variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and to make summary data available for the wider scientific community. The data pertains to unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies and serves as a reference set of allele frequencies for severe disease studies. This collection references variant information.",
