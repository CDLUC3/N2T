  "description": "The MEROPS database is an information resource for peptidases (also termed proteases, proteinases and proteolytic enzymes) and the proteins that inhibit them. These are hierarchically classified and assigned to a Family on the basis of statistically significant similarities in amino acid sequence. Families thought to be homologous are grouped together in a Clan. This collection references peptidase families.",
