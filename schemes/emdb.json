  "description": "The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) is a public repository for electron microscopy density maps of macromolecular complexes and subcellular structures. It covers a variety of techniques, including single-particle analysis, electron tomography, and electron (2D) crystallography. The EMDB map distribution format follows the CCP4 definition, which is widely recognized by software packages used by the structural biology community.",
