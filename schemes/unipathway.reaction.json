  "description": "UniPathway is a manually curated resource of enzyme-catalyzed and spontaneous chemical reactions. It provides a hierarchical representation of metabolic pathways and a controlled vocabulary for pathway annotation in UniProtKB. UniPathway data are cross-linked to existing metabolic resources such as ChEBI/Rhea, KEGG and MetaCyc. This collection references individual reactions.",
