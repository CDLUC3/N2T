  "description": "The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI, see MIR:00000383) is an identifier for chemical substances, and is derived solely from a structural representation of that substance. Since these can be quite unwieldly, particularly for web use, the InChIKey was developed. These are of a fixed length (25 character) and were created as a condensed, more web friendly, digital representation of the InChI.",
