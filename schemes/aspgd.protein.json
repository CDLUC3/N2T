  "description": "The Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD) is a repository for information relating to fungi of the genus Aspergillus, which includes organisms of clinical, agricultural and industrial importance. AspGD facilitates comparative genomics by providing a full-featured genomics viewer, as well as matched and standardized sets of genomic information for the sequenced aspergilli. This collection references protein information.",
