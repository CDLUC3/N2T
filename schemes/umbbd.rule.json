  "description": "The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD) contains information on microbial biocatalytic reactions and biodegradation pathways for primarily xenobiotic, chemical compounds. The UM-BBD Pathway Prediction System (PPS) predicts microbial catabolic reactions using substructure searching, a rule-base, and atom-to-atom mapping. The PPS recognizes organic functional groups found in a compound and predicts transformations based on biotransformation rules. These rules are based on reactions found in the UM-BBD database. This collection references those rules.",
