  "description": "CryptoDB is one of the databases that can be accessed through the EuPathDB (http://EuPathDB.org; formerly ApiDB) portal, covering eukaryotic pathogens of the genera Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Leishmania, Neospora, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Trichomonas and Trypanosoma. While each of these groups is supported by a taxon-specific database built upon the same infrastructure, the EuPathDB portal offers an entry point to all these resources, and the opportunity to leverage orthology for searches across genera.",
