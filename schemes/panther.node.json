  "description": "The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Classification System is a resource that classifies genes by their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of direct experimental evidence. PANTHER tree is a key element of the PANTHER System to represent &#x2018;all&#x2019; of the evolutionary events in the gene family. PANTHER nodes represent the evolutionary events, either speciation or duplication, within the tree. PANTHER is maintaining stable identifier for these nodes.",
