  "description": "STRING (Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) is a database of known and predicted protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they are derived from four sources:Genomic Context, High-throughput Experiments,(Conserved) Coexpression, Previous Knowledge. STRING quantitatively integrates interaction data from these sources for a large number of organisms, and transfers information between these organisms where applicable.",
