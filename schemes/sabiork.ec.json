  "description": "SABIO-RK is a relational database system that contains information about biochemical reactions, their kinetic equations with their parameters, and the experimental conditions under which these parameters were measured. The EC record provides for a given enzyme classification (EC) the associated list of enzyme-catalysed reactions and their corresponding kinetic data.",
