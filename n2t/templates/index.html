    <h1>N2T - Identifier Resolution Service</h1>
    <div>
    <p><code>N2T</code> is an identifier scheme resolver that given a provided identifier,
        matches it to an identifier scheme definition. Depending on the form of the request,
        a successful match will either redirect to the registered target or present
        information about the matched definition.</p>
    <p>Identifiers take the form:</p>
    <pre>
scheme:prefix/value
    </pre>
        <p><em>Note:</em> A refactored N2T service was deployed on 2024-06-24. The legacy service will be operational and fully
            functional until any issues with the new service are resolved. The legacy service is available at:
            <a href="https://legacy-n2t.n2t.net"><code>https://legacy-n2t.n2t.net</code></a>.</p>
        <p>The service API description is available at <a href="/api">/api</a>.</p>
        <p>The registered schemes are listed on the <a href="/_schemes.html">schemes page</a>.</p>
