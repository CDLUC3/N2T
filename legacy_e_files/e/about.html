<h1>About N2T.net</h1>
<p>N2T.net (Name-to-Thing) is a &quot;resolver,&quot; a kind of server that specializes
in <em>indirection</em>. Resolvers serve content indirectly by forwarding most
incoming requests to other servers rather than serving content directly
(this page being an exception). Resolvers are good at redirecting requests
to content servers, similar to URL shorteners like bit.ly and t.co.</p>
<div class="section" id="origins-of-n2t">
<h2>Origins of N2T</h2>
<p>The name &quot;n2t&quot; was chosen for several reasons. First, it is unique enough to be
easy to search for. Second, &quot;n2t&quot; is relatively opaque, which helps URLs based
at n2t.net to age and travel well, the presumption being that brand- and
language-neutrality can shield URLs from future embarrassment and forced
retirement due to long term evolving political, legal, and usability pressures.
The name is also short, which saves time and space – both in storage and in
&quot;visual real estate&quot; – across often-repeated acts of transcription and
citation. Finally, N2T's name was patterned after a set of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> (the main
Internet standards body) mapping operations for the URN (Uniform Resource Name)
dating back to 1997 (<a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2168">RFC 2168</a>): N2R (Name to Resource), N2L (Name to URL),
and N2C (Name to URC, 'C' = Characteristics/Citation).</p>
<p>N2T's technical infrastructure arose from the demand for a global ARK (Archival
Resource Key) resolver. All that a basic resolver needs is software to look up
a given incoming string in a table and to issue a &quot;server redirect&quot;, as found
in every web server since 1992. The approach taken by many systems (Handle,
DOI, etc.), is to create a &quot;silo&quot; that only works for one type of identifier.
Because making lookups fail except for certain parts of the alphabet is
exclusionary and artificial, the ARK resolver design took a more open and
general approach. The result was N2T, a scheme-agnostic resolver that currently
works for over 900 types of identifier, including ARKs, DOIs, Handles, PURLs,
URNs, ORCIDs, ISSNs, etc.</p>
<p>The main use of N2T is for &quot;persistent identifiers&quot;. An archive or publisher
that gives out content links (URLs) starting with n2t.net doesn't need to worry
about their breaking when content eventually moves to different servers.
Provided forwarding rules at N2T are updated, links starting with n2t.net
remain stable. (All persistent identifier systems rely on this same basic
principle.)</p>

<div class="section" id="features-unique-to-the-n2t-resolver">
<h2>Features Unique to the N2T Resolver</h2>
<p>Unlike URL shorteners, N2T can store more than one &quot;target&quot; (forwarding link)
for an identifier, as well as any kind or amount of metadata (descriptive
information) and links to metadata in different formats. When forwarding
doesn't work for some reason, such as a temporary outage or insufficient
permission at the target server, N2T can nonetheless return any persistent
information it has about the identified object. N2T also supports CORS
(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to securely enable JavaScript access to public
content with identifiers based at N2T. Some other unique features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Suffix passthrough.</strong> N2T supports &quot;<a class="reference external" href="/e/suffix_passthrough.html">suffix passthrough</a>&quot;, which
drastically reduces the number of individual identifiers that providers need
to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Inflections.</strong> It supports &quot;inflections&quot; and &quot;content negotiation&quot;, which
allow you to request descriptive information for identifiers that have it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Identifier-scheme-agnostic.</strong> N2T.net is unusual among resolvers because it
is not a silo that works with only one kind of identifier. It stores
individual identifiers of any kind, including both <a class="reference external" href="/e/ark_ids.html">ARK</a>s and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.doi.org">DOI</a>s, and
provides equal services to all kinds, regardless of origin.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Cross-scheme features.</strong> As a result N2T easily supports feature
combinations that some find surprising, such as ARK-style inflections
for DOIs, and ARKs that return <a class="reference external" href="https://www.datacite.org">DataCite</a> DOI metadata via content negotiation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Resolver and meta-resolver.</strong> Unusually, N2T is a &quot;meta-resolver&quot; (like
identifiers.org), but at the same time it stores about 50 million
identifiers. As a meta-resolver, it recognizes over 900 well-known identifier
types, including all those known to identifiers.org, and knows where their
respective servers are. Failing to find forwarding information for an
identifier that it looks up (in its regular resolver role), it assumes its
meta-resolver role and uses the identifier's type to look for an overall
&quot;target rule&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>NLID substitution.</strong> N2T has a special target rule substitution feature
for an identifier with a NAAN-like component (ARK, DOI, URN, Handle).
Wherever the string ${nlid} appears in the target string, the NLID
(NAAN-local identifier), which is everything to the right of the NAAN, will
be substituted. It is best if the forwarding URL ends up showing the &quot;compact
id&quot; (eg, the part starting &quot;ark:&quot;), but the NLID is useful since it is the
identifier part over which most identifier creators have direct control.
While it is easy for a web server to recognize an incoming NAAN, it still
requires a one-time webmaster action, and that may not be feasible. The
${nlid} substitution feature obviates that need because with a target rule
such as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
https://mysite.example.org/blog/${nlid}
</pre>
<p>N2T will forward an ARK such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ark:/12345/67890</span></tt> directly to</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
https://mysite.example.org/blog/67890
</pre>
<p>instead of forwarding it to (using the compact ARK)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
https://mysite.example.org/ark:/12345/67890
</pre>
<p>which avoids an extra local web server configuration step.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Prefix extension.</strong> N2T supports a &quot;prefix extension&quot; feature that permits
developers to extend a scheme or an ARK NAAN (both of which &quot;prefix&quot; an
identifier) with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-dev</span></tt> in order to forward to an alternate destination.
For example, if the NAAN <tt class="docutils literal">12345</tt> forwards to domain <tt class="docutils literal">a.b.org</tt>, then
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ark:/12345-dev/678</span></tt> forwards to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a-dev.b.org/678</span></tt>. It works similarly
for schemes, for example, if scheme <tt class="docutils literal">xyzzy</tt> forwards to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a.b.org/$id</span></tt>,
then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xyzzy-dev:foo</span></tt> forwards to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a-dev.b.org/foo</span></tt>.</p>
